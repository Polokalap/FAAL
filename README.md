# FAAL
Faal is like wofi or rofi but much worse.

How **I** use it:

- I added it to my hyprland config: `bind = $mainMod CONTROL, RETURN, exec, faal`
- I added [this](https://github.com/Polokalap/FAAL-configs/tree/main/Polokalap) to the config  at `~/.config/faal/`

Have you found any bugs?

Please open an issue! If it's urgent, please DM me on signal: polokalap.01

# How to install

- Arch Linux: `yay -S faal`
